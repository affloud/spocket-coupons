## Spocket Overview

**Spocket** is a dropshipping marketplace that streamlines the process of sourcing and selling products online. Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, Spocket connects merchants with thousands of vetted suppliers, offering fast shipping and high-quality products.
